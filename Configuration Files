⚙️ Configuration Files
Here's a breakdown of the main configuration files:

1. named.conf.options
This file controls the global options for the BIND9 server. Key settings include:

Forwarders: Google's DNS servers are set as forwarders.

allow-query { any; }: The server is open to queries from any client.

listen-on { any; }: The server listens for queries on all available network interfaces.

recursion yes;: Recursion is enabled.

2. named.conf.local
This file defines the custom zones for our domain.

A master zone is defined for prabhath.com which points to the forward.zone file.

A reverse zone 64.168.192.in-addr.arpa is also defined as a master zone, pointing to the reverse.zone file.

3. forward.zone
This file contains the DNS records for the prabhath.com domain.

SOA Record: Defines the start of authority for the zone.

NS Record: Specifies ns1.prabhath.com as the nameserver.

A Records:

prabhath.com -> 192.168.64.3

ns1.prabhath.com -> 192.168.64.3

www.prabhath.com -> 192.168.64.3

4. reverse.zone
This file maps IP addresses back to their hostnames.

SOA and NS Records: Similar to the forward zone file.

PTR Records:

10 -> prabhath.com.

20 -> www.prabhath.com.

✅ Verification & Status
The DNS server was tested to ensure it was running correctly.

Service Status
The systemctl status bind9 command shows that the BIND9 service is active (running).

DNS Query Testing
The dig and nslookup commands were used to test the DNS resolution from both the server and a client machine.

Server-side dig: The dig @localhost prabhath.com command successfully returned the A record 192.168.64.3.

Client-side nslookup: A client machine on the same network successfully resolved prabhath.com using the new DNS server. However, it failed to resolve ns1.prabhath.com due to a missing PTR record for it in the reverse zone.

Conclusion
This configuration provides a solid foundation for a local DNS server. It demonstrates the essential components of DNS, including forward and reverse lookups, and serves as a practical example of BIND9 implementation
